I've been working in bioinformatics since 1999 in various areas: protein families, structural bioinformatics, protein domains (function and evolution), structural genomics, ligand-protein interactions, chemoinformatics, microarrays, high-throughput sequencing, RNA-Seq, variant calling, cluster pipeline creation, and cancer bioinformatics.

Following a brief stint as a summer student working on [Pfam](http://pfam.xfam.org/) with [Alex Bateman](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/alex-bateman) at the [Sanger](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/), I did my PhD in the research group of [Cyrus Chothia](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/emeritus/cyrus-chothia/) at the [MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/) in Cambridge on the evolution of protein function via the combination of protein domains.  I then worked as a postdoc in the group of [Janet Thornton](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/janet-thornton) at the [EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) as part of the [Midwest Centre for Structural Genomics (MCSG)](http://www.mcsg.anl.gov/).  From there I refocused my efforts to high-throughput methods working in the [Bioinformatics Support Unit (BSU)](http://bsu.ncl.ac.uk/support/) a core facility at Newcastle University with [Simon Cockell](http://bsu.ncl.ac.uk/support/staff/simon-cockell/).  During this time I developed an interest in cancer genomics and most recently I have moved on to the [Northern Institute for Cancer Research (NICR)](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nicr/).
